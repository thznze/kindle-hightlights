For six months straight, January to June of 2016, I kept up this writing routine—while still working nine hours per day as a copywriter, while commuting an hour on the train to and from work, and while eating five meals per day and hitting the gym for an hour and a half every night. I worked. I lifted. And I wrote. And then every night when I got home from the gym around 9:00 p.m., I’d make myself a plate of gluten-free pasta, asparagus, and chicken, and work on my first memoir, Confessions of a Teenage Gamer, until midnight.

As we continued to walk, now on the grounds in front of the Eiffel Tower, Lewis explained his approach: Start speaking the very first day. Don’t be afraid to talk to strangers. Use a phrasebook to get started; save formal study for later. Use visual mnemonics to memorize vocabulary. What struck me were not the methods but the boldness with which he applied them. While I had timidly been trying to pick up some French, worrying about saying the wrong things and being embarrassed by my insufficient vocabulary, Lewis was fearless, diving straight into conversations and setting seemingly impossible challenges for himself.

Albert Einstein reportedly once said, ‘If I had an hour to solve a problem, I’d spend fifty-five minutes thinking about the problem and five minutes thinking about solutions.’ This quote often comes to mind when I hear the common misconception that therapy consists of sitting in a room and dwelling on your problems. It does involve thinking about your problems, but there is method in that. The most effective way to resolve a problem is to understand the problem inside out.

This particular line of thinking is likely to make you feel anxious, irritable, and possibly overwhelmed. Though we tend to associate our emotional responses with the events or circumstances in our lives—like the crowded parking lot and the woman ahead of us in line—the true cause of our emotional response to an event is the thoughts we have about that event.

You only need one bad night’s sleep to struggle with increased stress, trouble concentrating and low mood the next day. Self-control takes energy and if you haven’t had enough sleep, your brain has less access to that energy and becomes more vulnerable to high stress reactions, squashing your capacity to control your actions.
